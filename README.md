# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning (SVM)

This project focuses on predicting whether a patient has diabetes using clinical data specific to female patients. Built using Python and scikit-learn, the project walks through a complete machine learning pipeline—from data exploration and preprocessing to training and evaluating a support vector machine (SVM) classifier.

🔍 Project Overview

Dataset: Sourced from Kaggle, includes features like glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, and more.

Target: Predict whether a patient is diabetic (1) or non-diabetic (0) based on clinical indicators.

Tools Used: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and SVM for classification.


💡 What Makes This Project Interesting

1) The dataset focuses exclusively on female patients, offering a unique perspective on diabetes prediction in a specific demographic.

2) Emphasizes clean, interpretable code and step-by-step handling of real-world healthcare data.

3) Introduces data standardization, stratified train-test splitting, and performance metrics to assess model effectiveness.


🔧 Features and Techniques

Data Preprocessing: Handled null checks and applied standard scaling.

Model Building: Trained an SVM classifier with a linear kernel to distinguish between diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

Evaluation: Assessed performance using accuracy scores on both training and test data.



🚀 Potential Extensions

a) Apply more advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost.

b) Include feature importance or SHAP values for explainability.

c) Expand the dataset to include male patients for a broader analysis.

d) Deploy the model as a web application for use in clinics or health assessments.
